## Coalesced.ini
The coalesced.ini is an encoded configuration file that contains settings and object properties for the game, such as keybinds, ability data, difficulty scaling, and graphics settings. In Fall of Cybertron it contains all of the multiplayer customization data, allowing you to add custom colors or merge parts together.

For PC, it can be found inside `game folder\TransGame\Config\PC\Cooked`
